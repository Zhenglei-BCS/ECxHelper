Dose-Response Analysis
======================

This web interface utilize some helper functions to assist dose-response
analysis and reporting in the regulatory world. The app DRC offers the
ability of automatically fitting multiple models to the data and
recommends the best one according to the AIC criterion by default. It
also provides multiple criteria to compare the fitted models and gives
the user the option of choosing a different one from the default
selected model according to other criteria.

There are 4 tabs/menus in the app corresponding to 4 steps in the
analysis.

1. Load data:
-------------

The app can ingest various data formats including generic/retrieved data
from SDR, ToxRat, and a few Bayer specific data recording formats.

The acceptable data format are listed in the table below.

**If you need the app to accept a particular format of data, please
contact Zhenglei or file an issue to Gitlab repo.**

You can download the data if you would like to keep a copy of the
formatted data.

2. Data QC
----------

In the page you will find some basic figures and tables to check
possible errors in the datasheet and if the data meets the validation
criteria.

3. Model
--------

Here you can select multiple models to fit to the data or the app will
automatically fit all potentially appropriate models for you.

4. Report
---------

Report generation with options.

**If you need a certain type of report, please contact Zhenglei or file
a feature request to Gitlab repo. **
